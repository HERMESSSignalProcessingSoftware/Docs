\section{Component: Stamp}
\label{bes:Stamp}
The \textit{component STAMP} describes the logic used for the communication with the ADS 1147. (Look at figure \ref{fig:stamp}).  
SPI is used for the communication with the ADS 1147 analog - digial converter (ADC). The configuration of the ADC will be done from the microcontroller subsystem (MSS), therefore it will write to the \textit{STAMP} via APB3. \\ \\
During the measurment operations, this component will trigger an synchron signal \textit{New Avail}, signaling that the values of the ADCs are loaded successfully into the \textit{STAMP} component. On a rising edge of \textit{new avail} the data will be shown in the 64 bit databus. \\\\
The strain gauge rosetts (SGR) will be sampled with 2000 SP / s. The temperature sensor will be sampled with 10 SP/s.

\section{Komponente: Memory}
\label{bes:memory}
\subsection{Controll Unit}
The \textit{Controll Unit} (CU) implements the syncrhonizer finit statemachine to resolve smaller problems during measurment operations. The CU will be initialized with a falling edge on $\overline{reset}$. After that it is able to do parallel APB3 and measurment to memory operations. \\ \\
The data will be stored on a 1Gbit external flash memory, connected to the MSS.
